# Car Hero

Alternative names:

- car hero
- car window hero
- window hero

##  General Concept

Platformer / side-scroller`

**Story:** Family going somewhere by car. The child in the back of the car imagines a *hero* running in the window and jumping over / sliding under obstacles. The player is playing as that hero.

**Concepts:** 

- A game has a (mostly) fixed the same length (Trip from A -> B, this might be impacted by choosing different routes)
- The game always continues (screen always scrolls on)
- Player gathers (and maybe loses) points -> Higher score => better

## Ideas

- Hero selection:
	- Different look (skins)
	- Different skills (some kind of ability like shooting stuff, asking for support, invulnerability)
- Level selection  in form of choosing a car trip
	- Each trip offers different stuff such as
		- Different landscape
		- Different obstacles
		- Day/Night
		- Left/Right seat (screen going in the other direction and obstacle changes (more cars on the left side))
	- Trip ideas:
		- Visiting grandma
		- Going on holiday
		- In holiday
- General skills: Running, jumping, ducking, sliding, grapple-hook, ...
- Different different speed limits for different roads
- Boss fights?
	- e.g. a Truck or Train that comes and goes into/out of view
	- Could also be a section like overtaking on a highway where the game gets super fast and obstacle mostly become cars
- Decision point during stops (e.g. red light, train crossing)
	- Player can level up / gain new abilities
	- Choose different routes
	- These could occur in from of questions from the parents
		- "Should we go over the "mountain pass or take the tunnel?"
			- Lots of curves vs. darkness vs. speed (highway)
	- Or questions from the child
		- "Can I have something to drink?" => get some water spitting ability
- Player does not die (since the screen just goes on) but the player loses some kind of points or gets less points
	- Here we can have some nice visual effects like "getting splatted by a hydrant"
- Parents might give some hints for what comes next 
	- This could also be an ability / skill a player learns after a break e.g. by asking the parents "Can we play the game where we always call out blue cars?"
		- Whenever a blue car comes (the player can get ready to jump) a parent calls "Blue car"
	- "Do you see those birds"
	- "Look at that train"
	- "A ship on this tiny river?!"
- Can we involve siblings?
- Unlockables?
	- Skins
	- Heroes
	- Upgrades
	- Trips
	- Cars?
	- Locations 
		- E.g. after you mastered (getting enough points) the trip from home to vacation (e.g. beach vacation) you unlock the beach location
- Can we procedurally generate?
