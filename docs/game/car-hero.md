# Car Hero

Alternative names:

- Car hero
- Car window hero
- Window hero
- Window Runner

## 🎮 Concept

- Platformer / side-scroller
- A game with a (mostly) fixed length (Trip from A -> B, this might be impacted by choosing different routes)
- The game always continues (screen always scrolls on)
- Player gathers (and maybe loses) points -> Higher score => better

### 🌍 **Core Concept:**

The game takes place from the perspective of a child riding in the back seat of a car on a long trip. Out the window, the landscape whizzes by—and in that world, the player's character (the “imaginary hero”) is running, jumping, and performing acrobatic feats along the terrain that zips past. The hero dodges obstacles, collects imagination-powered items, and evolves as the child’s imagination deepens.
### 🧒 **Narrative Layer:**

The game could be structured around a loose story of the child’s journey—maybe they're moving to a new home, going on vacation, or visiting someone special. The hero’s powers and the world change depending on the child's mood or thoughts.

As the journey continues:
- If the child is bored → the world becomes abstract and dreamlike.
- If the child is excited → bright, energetic environments.
- If the child is nervous → the world becomes a little darker or filled with challenges.

This allows **emotional shifts** to influence the game environment, like levels reflecting the emotional palette of the moment.

### 🦸‍♂️ **Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Endless Runner Foundation:** Think _Canabalt_ or _Alto’s Adventure_, but with side-scrolling platforming and tricks.
- **Dynamic Environments:** Rooftops, fences, power lines, treetops, traffic signs, and rolling hills. The terrain is procedurally generated based on the landscape passing outside the window.
- **Child's Perspective = Power-Ups:** Thoughts from the child give the hero abilities (e.g., “He can fly now!” — cue a brief glide or jetpack).
- **Interactive Imagination System:** Let the player customize the hero with imaginative upgrades—e.g., “flaming sneakers,” “cloud-surfing board,” or “laser cape.”
- **Obstacle Interpretation:** Real-world objects are transformed by imagination—telephone poles become towering monsters, bridges are giant dragons, or puddles are lakes of lava.
### 🎨 **Visual Style Ideas:**

- **Mixed Perspective:** The background is a blurred, realistic-looking world (through the window), while the foreground (the hero's world) is vibrant, animated, and surreal.
- **Storybook or Sketchbook Aesthetic:** As if the child had drawn the hero’s world with crayons or markers.
### 🎵 **Sound Design:**

- Background: Muffled car noises, turning signals, passing cars, occasional snippets of conversation.
- Foreground: Whimsical, dynamic soundtrack that changes with speed, mood, and child’s emotions.
- Optional: The child could “narrate” the adventure with voice snippets or scribbled notes that appear on screen.
### ✨ **Optional Twists:**

- **Photo Mode:** Let players freeze the game to capture cool poses or weird environments.
- **Replay Mode:** Show the same level but from the child’s POV, watching the world outside as they daydream.
- **Memory Collectibles:** Scattered across levels are memory shards, triggering snippets of dialogue or inner thoughts.

## List of Ideas

- Hero selection:
	- Different look (skins)
		- Ninja, superhero, animal, "oneself", Skateboarder, Unicorn
	- Different skills (some kind of ability like shooting stuff, asking for support, invulnerability)
	- Since the kid "imagines" the hero we could also change the whole "theme" of the game based on hero selection
		- e.g. Selecting a "comic super hero" gives the classic "Pow" "Boom", "Peng" visual effect where a "post apocalyptic hero" produces a dystopia/dark landscape
- Level selection  in form of choosing a car trip
	- Each trip offers different stuff such as
		- Different landscape
		- Different obstacles
		- Day/Night
		- Left/Right seat (screen going in the other direction and obstacle changes (more cars on the left side))
	- Trip ideas:
		- Visiting grandma
		- Going on holiday
		- In holiday
- General skills: Running, jumping, ducking, sliding, grapple-hook, ...
- Different different speed limits for different roads
- Boss fights?
	- e.g. a Truck or Train that comes and goes into/out of view
	- Could also be a section like overtaking on a highway where the game gets super fast and obstacle mostly become cars
- Decision point during stops (e.g. red light, train crossing)
	- Player can level up / gain new abilities
	- Choose different routes
	- These could occur in from of questions from the parents
		- "Should we go over the "mountain pass or take the tunnel?"
			- Lots of curves vs. darkness vs. speed (highway)
	- Or questions from the child
		- "Can I have something to drink?" => get some water spitting ability
- Player does not die (since the screen just goes on) but the player loses some kind of points or gets less points
	- Here we can have some nice visual effects like "getting splatted by a hydrant"
- Parents might give some hints for what comes next 
	- This could also be an ability / skill a player learns after a break e.g. by asking the parents "Can we play the game where we always call out blue cars?"
		- Whenever a blue car comes (the player can get ready to jump) a parent calls "Blue car"
	- "Do you see those birds"
	- "Look at that train"
	- "A ship on this tiny river?!"
- Can we involve siblings?
- Unlockables?
	- Skins
	- Heroes
	- Upgrades
	- Trips
	- Cars?
	- Locations 
		- E.g. after you mastered (getting enough points) the trip from home to vacation (e.g. beach vacation) you unlock the beach location
- Can we procedurally generate?
