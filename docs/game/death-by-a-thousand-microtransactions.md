# Death by a thousand microtransaction

Alternative names:

- Freemium Slayer
- Freemium Fighter
- Microtransaction Massacre
- Pay2Lose
- No Pay, All Play

**Genre:** Top-down twin-stick shooter (endless roguelite)
**Platform:** Mobile (portrait or landscape mode)
**Style:** Stylized minimalism with satirical UI-themed enemies

## **Core Concept:**

You are “Player.exe”, a rebel app fighting through corrupted game worlds taken over by greedy monetization schemes. Every arena is a parody of exploitative game mechanics—each enemy represents a real monetization tactic.

## **Gameplay Loop:**

1. **Start a Run:**
   * Choose a starting weapon (e.g., *Adblock Beam*, *Privacy Shield*, *Refund Blaster*).
2. **Battle in Waves:**
   * Defeat enemies like:
     * **Ad Popper:** Spawns fullscreen overlays you can’t move through until destroyed
     * **Gem Troll:** Drops fake premium currency that clogs your inventory
     * **Energy Drainer:** Slows your movement unless killed fast
     * **The Whale:** Absorbs other enemies and gets stronger over time
3. **After Each Wave:**
   * Choose one of 3 randomized upgrades:
     * “Pop-up Immunity” – brief invincibility after hitting ads
     * “Unsubscribe Spin” – spin attack deletes subscription-based traps
     * “Code Injection” – chance to one-shot “premium” enemies
4. **Progression:**
   * Procedurally generated arenas, with increasing absurd monetization themes
   * Bosses every 5 waves: *The Gacha King*, *Timegate Titan*, *Pay2Win Phantom*

## **Upgrades & Replayability:**

* **Meta progression** through "Player Freedom Points" earned each run
* Unlock new anti-monetization tools (e.g., “Open Source Drone”, “Fake Currency Siphon”)
* Cosmetic-only unlocks as irony (e.g., “\$99.99 Sword” skin that does nothing)

## **Tone & Style:**

* UI and enemies mimic familiar mobile interfaces gone rogue
* Stylized visual feedback: glitches, pixel overloads, pop-up spam
* Sound design with fake button clicks, cash register jingles, muted screams of monetized souls

## General ideas

* You can buy some skin for $2 where the description of the skin is along the line of "This skin looks exactly like the default skin but fills the developer with pride and accomplishment"
  * Maybe other "buyables" but should be "donation based"
* Other bosses or enemies
  * Clickbait
  * Lootboxes
  * Pay-to-win (the player can pay-to-loose)
  * Paywalls
* Something with achievements
  * They can be bought? same with "fills the developer with pride and accomplishment"
* “Game Over: Insert Coin”
  * Can be destroyed?
* game concept could be:
	* monitizing stuff flies toward the player. The player can eliminate those. Different ways are needed depending on the object. E.g. cookies need to be rejected, ToC need to be accepted, ad need to be blocked or closed, loot-boxes need to be locked. If the player accidentally hits accept for cookies they have some drawbacks, or if clicked on an unopened loot-box they loose money, ads that are not closed need to be watched (player freezes)
* money can be used to buy upgrades (vampire survivor like) or as health (e.g. when a microtransaction hits you, you loose money)
* everything is behind pay walls (e.g. you have to pay to change settings)
	* this could already be part of the game
* upgrades could be
	* cookie monster that eats cookies
    	* cookie cutter
	* lock/key gun against loot-boxes
	* ad blocks as shiels
	* tiny lawyers that accept ToC
	* "clickers" that reject cookies
* The longer money is **not** spent, the more it hurts

It could be a vampire survivor like game but also building or TD, or deck building
