# Death by a thousand microtransaction


- game concept could be:
	- monitizing stuff flies toward the player. The player can eliminate those. Different ways are needed depending on the object. E.g. cookies need to be rejected, ToC need to be accepted, ad need to be blocked or closed, loot-boxes need to be locked. If the player accidentally hits accept for cookies they have some drawbacks, or if clicked on an unopened loot-box they loose money, ads that are not closed need to be watched (player freezes)
- money can be used to buy upgrades (vampire survivor like) or as health (e.g. when a microtransaction hits you, you loose money)
- everything is behind pay walls (e.g. you have to pay to change settings)
	- this could already be part of the game
- upgrades could be
	- cookie monster that eats cookies
	- lock/key gun against loot-boxes
	- ad blocks as shiels
	- tiny lawyers that accept ToC
	- "clickers" that reject cookies

It could be a vampire survivor like game but also building or TD, or deck building
