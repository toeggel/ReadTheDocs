# Game Design

A game needs a 1-sentence pitch: [Action, Action, Goal]
e.g.:

- Stardew Valley: Create a prosporing farm. To achieve this you can grow plants, care for cattles and befriend villagers.
- TD: Survive as long as possible by placing towers strategically and defeat waves of enemies.
-

## Skills / Leveling

- Don't attach skills to "Points" (e.g. Exp), this feels very un-immersive
  - Attach them to quests, craftables, npcs, rewards, achievements
    - Those could even be marked on a map. So if you want to learn a specific skill you know where to go.
    - Do something to lern a skill
    - See someone doing it - do it - learn and improve it
    - Craft it (e.g. new weapons or gears) and for this you need to find specific items
      - instead of "you need 3 points in defensive before you can learn _shield block_" you need to find 3 specific items and a trainer
- Maybe even don't attach the difficulty to a setting option. Find an amulet that you can "turn on" which makes enemies easier or find spells that increases your HP.

## Allow Experimenting

E.g.

- Allow a "rewind" mechanic shortly after doing something. If it doesn't quite work you can rewind.
- Allow multiple ways to solve somthing but there shouldn't be an (obvious) best solution.
