# The Clumsy God

> A young, inexperienced God was accidentally chosen by a primitive civilization to be their protector against the dark hordes. You - the young God - use miracles and other god like powers - that are hard to control - to save, but also not harm the civilization.

Alternative names:

- **Kinda Godlike**
- Chosen, by Mistake
- The Young God
- Divine Oops

### Core Concept:

A primitive civilization prays for a god to protect them — and by some cosmic accident, you, an untested, unfinished god, are chosen. The darkness is real. The enemies are many. And your powers?
Unstable. Incomplete. Sometimes hilarious.
Your job: hold back the hordes of darkness across a series of escalating battles — using divine powers that often misfire or behave unexpectedly.

### Gameplay Structure:

#### 1. Start of Run:

Civilization chooses you (a randomly generated divine trait package: e.g., “God of Heat & Growth, but Clumsy and Emotional”).

You are given a small, procedurally generated “starting miracle set” (with unknown quirks).

#### 2. Each Battle Phase:

Auto-battler format (your chosen units defend a point or region against waves).

You can cast divine powers during or between waves — but they’re unreliable.

E.g., “Holy Flame” might spread to allies, “Shield of Light” may blind your units, “Lightning” might fork uncontrollably.

Between waves, you draft new units (avatars, summoned spirits, converted followers) or miracles — all with potential blessings and curses.

#### 3. Progression Phase:

Survive waves to earn “Faith” from your people.

Faith is used to stabilize or upgrade miracles, bless units, or suppress divine glitches.

Over time, you gain divine maturity — unlocking perks like “Clarity: 10% less misfire” or “Judgment: Know miracle outcomes before casting.”

#### 4. End of Run:

The darkness either overwhelms your people — or you buy enough time for them to build the “Great Temple” and ascend together.

Regardless, your god matures a bit more, gaining meta progression (divine traits, stable miracle access, future unlocks).

### Systems Overview:

#### 1. Units (Auto-Battling Followers):

**Classes:** Basic melee, ranged, healer, buffer, summon.
**Divine Blessings** (Randomly Assigned): E.g., “Touched by Fire,” “Blessed Clumsiness,” “Divine Echo.”

Each has a quirky behavior when affected by miracles — e.g., a unit may grow when healed, or explode when blessed with speed.

#### 2. Miracles (Your Powers):

Core Mechanic: You don’t control them precisely — they are:

- Misfire-prone (wrong targets, delayed effects, too strong)
- Overlapping in effects (a miracle might bless and curse)
- Influenced by “Mood” or divine instability.

You learn how to predict and mitigate them over runs.

**Examples:**

“Shield of Rebirth” – Revives fallen allies, but may also resurrect enemies.

“Rain of Clarity” – Clears status effects… including your buffs.

“Wrathful Leap” – Teleports a unit into enemy lines for AoE damage… sometimes chooses a healer.

#### 3. Divine Mood / Stability:

Your emotional state (rage, fear, joy) affects how powers behave.

Your state changes dynamically through battle or decisions (e.g., you panic when units die too fast).

Unlock late-game traits that let you channel or manipulate these moods.

### Meta Progression:

Unlock divine traits: “Reliable,” “Storm-Forged,” “Apathetic but Accurate.”

Access more stable miracles over time.

Unlock alternate gods: “The Sleeping Child,” “The Hungry Flame,” “The Broken Mirror.”

### Visual & Dev Scope Notes:

**Visuals:** Stylized 2D or low-poly. Units are simple — silhouettes, icons, or low-effort sprites with flair.

**UI:** Think Slay the Spire meets Auto Chess: drag/drop units into formation + click powers with cooldowns.

**Audio:** Minimal but expressive — reactions to miracles (gasps, cheers, crackling power).

**Code Focus:** Create a tight event system: units + powers + modifiers + randomness.

---

### Tone & Feel:

**Tone:** Whimsical but tragic. A god in over their head, trying to help, sometimes failing in heartbreaking ways.

**Inspirations:**

- Slay the Spire (deck mechanics, randomness as strategy)
- Loop Hero (abstract civilization theme)
- Auto Chess / Super Auto Pets (hands-off combat)
- Cult of the Lamb (faith, style, dark humor)

## List of Ideas

- God power misfire e.g:
	- simple fire for cooking or light turns into infernos
	- rain into floods
	- electrocuting enemies produce unpredictable storms
- More "Faith Points" from the civilization gives more power - more power also means it can do more harm or more stability of powers (could be unlockable upgrades).
- You can unlock passive blessings that stabilize powers but reduce strength — strategic trade-offs.
- Citizens learn to adapt around your chaos. Flood-resistant buildings, thunder-prayers to avoid storms, etc.
- Accidents might be treated as intentional by the civilization (why does he punish us?!)
- A "bar meter" which gives power to use miracles. the lower the bar the higher chance it misfires. There are critical levels where misfire is almost certain.
- New miracles are unknown (or at least the concrete outcome) until cast once. e.g. a new fire miracle might just produce a fire but it might also be a volcano miracle.
- If a miracle gets used more often it's less prone to misfire.
- God created worlds and suns, they have generally too much power to guide a civilization
  - "Creating sun" can be used as "fire" if tuned down.
  - "Creating planet" can create land or be used to throw rocks.
