# Principles

## CAP Theorem

A theorem about distributed computing systems that states that a computer system can at best, provide two of the three properties from the following list:

**Consistency (C):** All clients see the same data at the same time no matter which node they connect to.
**Availability (A):** Any client which requests data gets a (non-error) response even if some of the nodes are down..
**Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate despite network failures (between nodes).

| --------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Sacrifice |                  | Availability                                    | Consistency                                         |
| Use Case  | Single-node only | Strong consistency.<br>Banks, financial systems | Low latency.<br>Consistency requirement is not high |

If you go with microservices you already chose Partition Tolerance and can therefore only choose either Availabilty or Consistency.

## Misc

- Do you want fast answer or correct answer?
- Chatty applications will fail at scale.
