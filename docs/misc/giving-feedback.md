# Giving Feedback

## Summary

* Be (very) concrete
* State facts don't make assumptions
    * Where/When did it happen (also see: concrete)
    * What did the other person do or say (facts)
        * **NOT** "I belive you said that because you thought..." 
* Impact on me or others
    * How did that make me feel?

## Notes

Sponanoes Feedback (e.g. after a Meeting)
* What can I do differently? Why?
* What could I have done better?

**SBIS**
- **S**ituation
    - Give concrete context / situation
- **B**ehaviour
    - Observation and not assumption
- **I**mpact
    - impact on (and feelings for) me and/or others 
- **S**uggestion or Request
    - I can request -> other can reject


**Perparation (for difficult feedbacks)**
**My Goals & Intentions**
- What do I want to achieve? What is the key message?
- What outcome do I expect
- Do I have all information
- Do I wish my "vis-a-vis" to prepare and or self reflect beforehand?
- Setting and timing.

**Our Relationship**
- my role
- current relationship
- biased history?
- haveing my mood and attitude in check

**Vis-a-Vis expectations**
- Whats the current mood and situation of my vis-a-vis (let them at least mentally prepare for it)
- What is the conversation about
- Are the intendet goals of us tow in conflic or in congruence?

**5 phases (plus)**
- plus
    - **Context**: invite and inform (clearly and) transparently why I want to talk and whats the **core theme**
- Phase 1 (key, we have to start well!)
    - Connect: build an atmosphere (e.g. Small talk or make it explicit "It's gonna be a difficult situation and I feel a bit nervouse about it.)
    - Frame: set a clear context: "why are we here?", make a clear cut after the connection
        - Maybe I have to make a concrete switch ".. Thats very interesting but we have to switch to the actual topic, ..."
    - Naming: Name the facts (issue) in the beginning. Use the **SBIS** model
- Phase 2
    - Listen to the vis-a-vis perspective
- Phase 3
    - Share my perspective, state a request (SBIS)
- Phase 4
    - Seek alignment (not necessary agreement). How do we proceed?. Together (or the other). Let them make suggestions (I can add).
    - Make a contract on the way forward.
- Phase 5
    - Close consciously
    - Don't "water it down" ("But it is actually ok what you do...", "It's not that bad... ")
