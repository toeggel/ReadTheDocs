# PowerPoint

Follow these 5 point to improve your PowerPoint presentations:

* One message per page
* Working memory => redundency effect => if I speak and show the same context, nothing get remembered (1 + 1 = 0)
    * Move text down to the notes section
    * Use the slide to show short sweet text bits and an image to enhance the message I talk about
* Your attention goes to big objects, moving objects, high contrast objects, signaling objects (red, yellow, orange)
    * Use to your advantage.
    * **The most important part of a page should be the biggest** (e.g. make title small since it is often not the important part of a page)
* Contrast to control the focus 
    * when new text appears on a page make it a strong contrast and weaken the contrast of existing text (e.g. if a new bullet point is blended in)
    * Use it for big tables by makeing single rows or column a better contrast (the one you want to focus on)
    * Use dark background (instead of white)
        * Helps to move the focus to the speaker / presenter
* No more then 7 objects per page

Following those tips usually lead to more slides => No Problem, Maybe don't show the numbers (10 / 80) since it is exausting.
