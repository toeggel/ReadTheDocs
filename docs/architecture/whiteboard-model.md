# Whiteboard model

Whiteboard model of the system is a high level abstraction of the system that can be drawn on a whiteboard with the idea that every member of the team (or at least seniors) can draw it from memory. This caps the complexity of the model.

The idea is similar to the [C4](c4.md) model and most of the time is a mix between the container model with interesting facts about components or a mix of the system context with container model data. Sometimes it also makes sense to have multiple views. In the end it is not that strict or formal.
