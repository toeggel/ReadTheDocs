# Micro frontend (MFE)

MFE is recommended for teams that require applications to be deployed independently. It is important to consider the cost of MFEs and decide whether it makes sense for your own teams.

With MFE architecture, a large application is split into:

1. A single **Host** application that references external...
2. **Remote** applications, which handle a single domain or feature.
