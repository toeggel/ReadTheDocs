# Service Bus Messaging 

## Queue
 > **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Use when there is a need to pass the message in the one-to-one system. 

Messages in queues are ordered and timestamped on arrival.

## Topic
 > **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Use when there is a need to send the message to multiple systems.

Topics can have multiple, independent subscriptions, which attach to the topic and otherwise work exactly like queues from the receiver side.
