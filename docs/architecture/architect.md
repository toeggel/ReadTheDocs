# Software Architect

The role of software architects is to **make high-level design choices** and **dictate technical standards**. They needs to **see the bigger picture**.
A software architect needs to **connect people**. They are the fast elevators in a building to connect the floors. Higher management, mid-levels and engineering are often disconnected and isolated. A software architect needs to bring those people (or there idea, understanding, inputs, ..) together.

See: [iSAQB - Rolle Architekt](isaqb.md#Rolle%20Architekt)

*Everything* in software architecture has a trade-off. Thinking like an architect is analyzing these trade-offs, then asking “which is more important?"

An architect should make other people smarter - not because they are dumb but because they work on different levels. We use metaphors, models, connect different peoples, ... to achieve this.
