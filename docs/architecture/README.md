## 📄 Quick Reference

- **[architecture-cheat-sheet.md](architecture-cheat-sheet.md)** - Comparison table of different architectural styles

## 🎯 Getting Started

If you're new to software architecture, we recommend starting with:
1. [architecture.md](01-concepts/architecture.md) - Core principles and fundamentals
2. [c4.md](01-concepts/c4.md) - Learn about the C4 model for documentation
3. [architecture-cheat-sheet.md](architecture-cheat-sheet.md) - Quick comparison of architectural styles

For specific topics:
- **Understanding architecture patterns?** → Start with [02-styles/](02-styles/)
- **Need to document a decision?** → See [04-governance/architectural-decision-records.md](04-governance/architectural-decision-records.md)
- **Looking for implementation patterns?** → Check [03-patterns-and-ops/](03-patterns-and-ops/)
