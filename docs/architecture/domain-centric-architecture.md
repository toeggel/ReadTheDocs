# Domain Centric Architectures
Examples are [Onion](onion.md),  [Hexagonal](hexagonal-architecture.md) and Clean architecture.

Domain-centric (or domain-driven) architectures place the business domain - its concepts, rules, and language - at the core of the software design. Rather than starting from technical layers (UI, database, etc.), development revolves around domain models that capture the essential business logic.

**Key Ideas:**

- **Domain as the Core:** The domain model is the "source of truth"” and all other layers (UI, persistence, infrastructure) serve it.
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Developers and domain experts share a consistent vocabulary embedded in the model itself.
- **Bounded Contexts:** Complex domains are divided into smaller, coherent areas, each with its own model and rules.  
- **Layered Design:** Often follows a structure like Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Interface or similar.
- **Strategic Integration:** Context maps define how different bounded contexts interact - through APIs, events, or shared kernels.
