# C4

There are four types of C4 models, **each one for a different audience and containing a different level of detail**. These are the context, container, components, and code diagrams that make up your C4 model. The order doesn't matter. 
Usually level 1 & 2 makes a lot of sense, level 3 only in some situations and level 4 is hardly ever used.

![C4 Overview](../assets/c4-overview.png "C4 Overview")

## 1. (System) Context

Context diagrams are the most general description of what your system does, who will use it, and what other systems it will interact with. A context diagram will help you describe the scope of your project and help you pinpoint who the user is and what problem youâ€™re going to solve.

## 2. Containers

The container diagram takes the first step into describing the software system and shows the APIs, applications, databases, and microservices that the system will use. Each of these applications or services is represented with a container and the interactions between them are shown at a high level.

## 3. Components

The component diagram details groups of code within a single container. These components represent abstractions of your codebase.

## 4. Code (e.g. Classes)

The last level requires lots of detail to show how the code of a single component is actually implemented. To do this, you would want to make a UML class diagram or entity relationship diagram that describes the component.

# Diagrams

See: [Notation](https://c4model.com/#Notation)

A **box** needs a meaningful title and type and a short description, summary or bullet point list.
**Lines** go only in one direction showing the most important dependencies or data flow. Make explicit annotations about the purpose.
Have a key/legend to explain shapes, line styles, colors, borders, acronyms, etc.
