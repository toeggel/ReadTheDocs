# System Prompt

System prompts serve as the **foundational instructions** that dictate an AI's behavior. They establish the framework for how the AI will interact and respond, similar to a job description for an employee. These prompts define the AI's role, its area of expertise, and the overall tone it should adopt.

**Key elements of system prompts include:**
- Behavioral Framing: Defining the AI's role, personality, or expertise.
- Constraint Setting: Establishing limitations or rules for the AI's responses.
- Context Provision: Providing background information or situational context.
- Ethical Guidance: Incorporating ethical guidelines or value alignments.

 A system prompt is inserted as a templated textÂ in the beginning of the Prompt.
